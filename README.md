# Wonderland Mobile Game Client

## Game Description

Wonderland is the first mobile-based application metaverse platform built on Solana that encourages players to interact, learn (or grow) and play through a social-to-earn system. For the first time, users would be able to interact with their alter-ego, dress them up with NFT collectables and interact with each other on mobile in the blockchain. Wonderland introduces many innovations into the blockchain gaming sphere, including social-tracking mechanics, Defi token collateral stakes DAO-governed game mechanics, and an open metaverse with smart contract interoperability and mobile world open gaming.

## Social Index

The social index is the unique feature that powers the Wonderland ecosystem. The initial part of the Social Index is used to gather, track and reward users who participate in the ecosystem through socialisation and personal engagement with the community.

The social index uses a combined algorithm that analyzes a user's social behaviour within the Wonderland Social Metaverse to give a popularity score based on how much the user interacts with people, receives respect/like score based on daily votes, contribution to Wonderland society such as providing quality content to running events as well as good behaviour. The existence of Wonderland Social Index is to entice and encourage social interaction while rewarding users similar to how traditional social media platforms are rewarded when users provide good content and receive followers to react to their posts. In addition, users with high WSI (Wonderland Social Index) would be able to enter and unlock new interactions, activities and places to go.

The Social Index is broken down into the 3 key parts. The social index score shows how each individual would be able to accumulate their Social Index Score as well as how the system records the interaction on-chain. Next, it would talk about how Social Index is maintained throughout the ecosystem as social engagement activity increases throughout the ecosystem so that it’s balanced that there will be people who should be rewarded for doing more while others will have to continue contributing or risk a lower score. Lastly, the rewards section will show the various earning potential, features unlocked and VIP access for users based on their respective Social Index.
